===========  ====================================================================

This is an efficient Python/Cython implementation of the semiparametric
`XL-mHG test`__ for enrichment in ranked lists. The XL-mHG test is an extension
of the nonparametric `mHG test`__, which was developed by `Dr. Zohar
Yakhini`__ and colleagues.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ setup.py build
    $ setup.py install [--user]

Getting started
---------------

The `xlmhg` package provides two functions (one simple and more more advanced)
for performing XL-mHG tests. These functions are documented in the
`User Manual`__. Here's a quick example using the "simple" test function:

.. code-block:: python

    import xlmhg
    stat, cutoff, pval = xlmhg.xlmhg_test(v, X, L)

Where: ``v`` is the ranked list of 0's and 1's, represented by a NumPy array of
integers, ``X`` and ``L`` are the XL-mHG parameters, and the return values have
the following meanings:

- ``stat``: The XL-mHG test statistic
- ``cutoff``: The cutoff at which XL-mHG test statistic was attained
- ``pval``: The XL-mHG p-value
